                Cyber ethics, also known as internet ethics or digital ethics, refers to the 
                ethical principles and guidelines that govern the use of technology, particularly
                 in the online realm. As our dependence on digital technologies continues to grow,
                issues related to privacy, security, and responsible online behavior have become
                increasingly significant. Cyber ethics seeks to address these concerns and establish
                 a framework for ethical conduct in the digital space.
